This was made to combat the issue of the [older bot](https://github.com/codesidian/Python-MissionChiefBot) being slow, and also difficult for users to install. Everything is there ready for the user at one click of a button.
Find the scan report of the exe [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/ODM5NDNhYjMzNjgwNjI0MDQ2ZDcwNTE4ODZkOTIzNjM6MTU4Nzc3NzYwMQ==/detection) incase you're worried it's a virus. 

## Features 
- Anti detection features, randomized timings with the ability to be set by the user for all tasks.
- Auto transport patients, and prisoners.
- Ability to complete alliance missions.
- Automatically despatches the closest units.
- Only sends the exact requirements, rather than leaving your missions incomplete.
- Send only a batch of missions at a time - set `missions_per_run ` to the amount required in your `config.ini`.
- Super fast, the bot is built with speed in mind! With the ability to despatch around 131 missions in around **6 minutes**.
- Multiple domains supported.
- Multiple accounts at one time, just create another bot in another folder and off you go.
- Transparent and legit development team.


## How to use
If you'd prefer to see a video tutorial you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9adxIIqONTw) or follow the below:

1. Download the code [here](https://github.com/jackbayliss/Mission-Chief-Bot/archive/master.zip), then extract the files to a folder of your choice (Just keep the files together)

2. Once done open the `config.ini` inside the config folder and replace corresponding `username` and `password` with your account information, and `server` with the country  your account is registered on such as `uk`. All working countries will be in the `server.ini`

`missions_per_run` is the amount of missions it will do per batch, so if it finds 100 missions and you've set it to 50 it will *ONLY* do 50. Set `show_own `to true if you want to ignore alliance missions, else set it to false.

## Free Vs Sponsored 
The bot is completely free for versions `0.0.9.8.1` and below- for the new version it's a 'pay what you can system'- so if you sponsor me for as little as $1 a month you'll get access to the new versions, this gives you more features than free versions that will gradually be added, as well as quicker replies / fixes where possible. 

I regularly check sponsors, and add users and remove users.. You can see the sponsor system via GitHub [here](https://github.com/sponsors/jackbayliss) allowing you to privately or publicly sponsor me. Be aware I will require your mission chief username in order to give you access so please send it me via email, or Discord message. If you'd rather not let me know it feel free to use the free version.

### Windows
Just double click the .exe and you're up and running!

### Linux
Please see the mac/linux branch [here](https://github.com/jackbayliss/Mission-Chief-Bot/tree/mac)

## Why is the source code hidden?
This is to mainly prevent the developers of the website seeing exactly how the bot is able to do it so quickly, this is more of a prolonging the life of the bot exercise.
